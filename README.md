## A program that continuously draws on a website using p5.js
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. It is based on the original Processing project and uses many of the same principles, but with a modern, web-based approach.

To create a program that continuously draws on a website using p5.js, you would first need to include the library in your web page. This can be done by adding a <script> tag to the page, with the src attribute pointing to the p5.js library file. You would then write your script using the p5.js API, which provides a range of functions and methods for drawing and manipulating graphics on the page.

In your script, you can use the draw() function to create a loop that runs continuously, allowing you to update and redraw the graphics on the page at regular intervals. This is where you would use the p5.js drawing functions to create your visuals. For example, you could use the line() function to draw lines on the page, the rect() function to draw rectangles, and the ellipse() function to draw circles.

In addition to the basic drawing functions, p5.js also provides a range of other features and tools that can be used to create more complex and interactive visualizations. These include functions for working with color, text, images, and user input, as well as tools for organizing and structuring your code. With p5.js, you have a powerful and flexible tool for creating engaging and dynamic visuals on the web.
